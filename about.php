        Hi, my name is Fiorella.
        <br>
        It means little flower in Italian.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am a junior at Cornell University studying Information Science with a
        minor in both Business and Environmental Science.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am a Peruvian immigrant currently living in Long Island, NY. Since I
        was a little girl, I always liked drawing and art. When I got to Cornell,
        I decided to explore that side of me by concentrating in UX.
        <br>
        <br>
        Currently, I am working on gaining more experience within this field,
        but I have the qualities to succeed in any project given to me while
        being a team player from my previous internship and experiences. </p1>
